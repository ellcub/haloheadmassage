      <h2>What is it and what can I expect?</h2>
      <p>Indian Head Massage takes place seated in a chair
      and works on the upper back, shoulders, upper arms, neck, scalp and face.</p>

      <p>It can be done through clothes or directly on the skin.
      For ladies, a strapless top or camisole type vest top can be worn to allow
      the massage to be directly on the upper back and shoulders.
      You can choose to have it with a little oil, or not -
      whatever you prefer that day. (Oil would not be used if done through clothes.)</p>


      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>Indian Head Massage works on multiple levels.  By working on the muscles of
      the face, scalp, neck and shoulders, it helps to release knots and tension in those muscles.
      It increases circulation and encourages a fresh supply of oxygenated blood to the tissues.
      It helps with lymphatic drainage, removing waste from the tissues.
      On a subtle energy level, it works on the upper chakras and on the meridian lines of Chinese medicine.</p>

      <h2>A brief history of Indian Head Massage</h2>
      <p>Massage has been an important part of Indian life for millennia, with roots in the ancient medicine
      system of Ayurveda.  Massage features in the earliest Ayurvedic texts, dating back nearly 4,000 years,
      as a way to encourage the body's natural healing abilities.</p>
      <p>Indian women have been offering head massages to their daughters for over a thousand years.
      They use different oils depending on the season and massage the scalp to keep the hair in good condition.
      Indian barbers also offer a head massage as a treatment to their clients so
      they feel refreshed and invigorated.</p>

      <p>In 1973 Narendra Mehta came to England to study to be a physiotherapist.
      Growing up in India, he had experienced head massage regularly and knew how
      stress-relieving and refreshing it was. He was disappointed to find that in
      England, even full-body massage stopped at the neck.  He decided to go back to
      India and study head massage so he could bring this beneficial therapy to the West.
      He expanded the tradition to include the neck, shoulders and upper arms.</p>
